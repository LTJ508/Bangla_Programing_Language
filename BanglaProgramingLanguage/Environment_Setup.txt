01. save the antlr jar file in this directory:
	C:\antlr\antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar

02. Run two command in your Command Prompt:
	setx ANTLR_JAR "C:\antlr\antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar" /m
	setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\antlr" /m

03. for generating parser and lexer:
	java -jar %ANTLR_JAR% -Dlanguage=Cpp MyGrammar.g4

04. Install the Cmake from this website:
	https://cmake.org/download/
	download the Windows x64 Installer MSI File and install it.
05. move to the C:\antlr\ and run the command prompt from the address bar:
	git clone https://github.com/antlr/antlr4.git

06. move to the C:\antlr\antlr4\runtime\Cpp folder and open the command prompt:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles"

07. Open this file using codeblocks
	"C:\antlr\antlr4\runtime\Cpp\build\LIBANTLR4.cbp"

08. In Codeblocks select the build target as antlr4_static

09. Now build the project to create the antlr4-runtime.a static library. (It will take some Time)
	"C:\antlr\antlr4\runtime\Cpp\build\runtime\libantlr4-runtime-static.a"

10. Now back to our own project

11. Go to Project > Build Options > Search Directories > Compiler and add the path to ANTLR runtime headers
	"C:\antlr\antlr4\runtime\Cpp\runtime\src"
12. Under Linker Settings in Build Options, add the path to
	"C:\antlr\antlr4\runtime\Cpp\build\runtime\libantlr4-runtime-static.a"

13. Go to Project > Build Options > Compiler Settings > Other Compiler Options add this value
	-std=c++17

14. Go to Project > Build options....
	Select your project, then go to the #defines section under Compiler settings.
	Add ANTLR4CPP_STATIC as a new definition.

15. Now Ready to construct the IR Generator
